            A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to
            another computer program and its user, also known as the client. In
            a data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on
            is also frequently referred to as a server. That machine might be a
            dedicated server or it might be used for other purposes. In the
            client/server programming model, a server program awaits and
            fulfills requests from client programs, which might be running in
            the same or other computers. A given application in a computer might
            function as a client with requests for services from other programs
            and as a server of requests from other programs. The process of
            creating virtual machines involves installing a lightweight software
            component called a hypervisor onto a physical server. The
            hypervisor's job is to enable the physical server to function as a
            virtualization host. The virtualization host makes the physical
            server's hardware resources -- such as CPU time, memory, storage and
            network bandwidth -- available to one or more virtual machines. An
            administrative console gives administrators the ability to allocate
            specific hardware resources to each virtual server. This helps to
            dramatically drive down hardware costs since a single physical
            server can run multiple virtual servers, as opposed to each workload
            needing its own physical server.

            It is challenging to give a single precise definition for the term
            driver. In the most fundamental sense, a driver is a software
            component that lets the operating system and a device communicate
            with each other. For example, suppose an application needs to read
            some data from a device. The application calls a function
            implemented by the operating system, and the operating system calls
            a function implemented by the driver. The driver, which was written
            by the same company that designed and manufactured the device, knows
            how to communicate with the device hardware to get the data. After
            the driver gets the data from the device, it returns the data to the
            operating system, which returns it to the application. Not all
            drivers communicate directly with a device. For a given I/O request
            (like reading data from a device), there are often several drivers,
            layered in a stack, that participate in the request. The
            conventional way to visualize the stack is with the first
            participant at the top and the last participant at the bottom, as
            shown in this diagram. Some of the drivers in the stack might
            participate by transforming the request from one format to another.
            These drivers do not communicate directly with the device; they just
            manipulate the request and pass the request along to drivers that
            are lower in the stack.

          <h3>CLOUD:</h3>
          <p>
            Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system
            resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing
            power, without direct active management by the user.[1] The term is
            generally used to describe data centers available to many users over
            the Internet.[2] Large clouds, predominant today, often have
            functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers.
            If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be
            designated an edge server. Clouds may be limited to a single
            organization (enterprise clouds[3][4]), or be available to multiple
            organizations (public cloud). Cloud computing relies on sharing of
            resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale. Advocates of
            public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows companies
            to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents
            also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their
            applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and
            less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly
            adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable
            demand,[4][5][6] providing the burst computing capability: high
            computing power at certain periods of peak demand.[7] Cloud
            providers typically use a "pay-as-you-go" model, which can lead to
            unexpected operating expenses if administrators are not familiarized
            with cloud-pricing models.[8] The availability of high-capacity
            networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the
            widespread adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented
            architecture and autonomic and utility computing has led to growth
            in cloud computing.[9][10][11] By 2019, Linux was the most widely
            used operating system, including in Microsoft's offerings and is
            thus described as dominant.[12] The Cloud Service Provider (CSP)
            will screen, keep up and gather data about the firewalls, intrusion
            identification or/and counteractive action frameworks and
            information stream inside the network.

          <h3>TOOLS:</h3>
          <p>
            A tool is an object used to extend the ability of an individual to
            modify features of the surrounding environment. Although many
            animals use simple tools, only human beings, whose use of stone
            tools dates back hundreds of millennia, have been observed using
            tools to make other tools. The set of tools required to perform
            different tasks that are part of the same activity is called gear or
            equipment. While one may apply the term tool loosely to many things
            that are means to an end (e.g., a fork), strictly speaking an object
            is a tool only if, besides being constructed to be held, it is also
            made of a material that allows its user to apply to it various
            degrees of force. If repeated use wears part of the tool down (like
            a knife blade), it may be possible to restore it; if it wears the
            tool out or breaks it, the tool must be replaced. Thus tool falls
            under the taxonomic category implement, and is on the same taxonomic
            rank as instrument, utensil, device, or ware.

          <h3>GUIDES:</h3>
          <p>
            Mountain guides are those employed in mountaineering; these are not
            merely to show the way but stand in the position of professional
            climbers with an expert knowledge of rock and snowcraft, which they
            impart to the amateur, at the same time assuring the safety of the
            climbing party. This professional class of guides arose in the
            middle of the 19th century when Alpine climbing became recognized as
            a sport.[1] In Switzerland, the central committee of the Swiss
            Alpine Club issues a guides’ tariff which fixes the charges for
            guides and porters; there are three sections, for the Valais and
            Vaudois Alps, for the Bernese Oberland, and for central and eastern
            Switzerland.[1] In Chamonix (France) a statue has been raised to
            Jacques Balmat, who was the first to climb Mont Blanc in 1786.[1]
            Other notable European guides are Christian Almer, Jakob and
            Melchior Anderegg, Klemens Bachleda, Auguste Balmat, Alexander
            Burgener, Armand Charlet, Michel Croz, François Devouassoud, Angelo
            Dibona, Andreas Heckmair, the Innerkofler family, Conrad Kain,
            Christian Klucker, and Matthias Zurbriggen.
